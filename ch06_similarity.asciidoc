=== What does it mean that the compounds are similar？

Expressions that are somewhat shape is similar are not scientific. In the chemorinformatics, similarity or unsimilarity(distance) is used as quantitative metrics. 

In this section, we will introduce two mejor metrics.

==== Descriptor

////
分子の全体的な特徴を数値で表現するものを記述子と呼びます。分子量や極性表面性（PSA）、分配係数(logP)などがあり、現在までに多くの記述子が提案されています。これらの記述子の類似性を評価することで２つの分子がどのくらい似ているかを表現することが可能です。また分子全体の特徴を1つの数字で表現しており局所的な特徴ではないということに注意してください。

NOTE: いくつかの記述子に関しては市販ソフトでないと計算できない場合があります。
////

A parameter that represents the overall characteristics of a molecule numerically is called a descriptor. Many descripors are proposed so far such as molecular weight, polar surface area(PSA)  and partition coefficient(logP). It is possible to evaluate a similarity between two molecules with these descriptors. Please note that descriptor represents whole molecular feature as a numeric value and it is not local feature.

NOTE: There is a case where it is needed commercial software to calculate some descriptors.

==== Fingerprint

Another is fingerprint. A fingerprint is a binary representation of a partial structure of a molecule as a binary 0, 1, and it corresponds to the presence or absence of a partial structure and on (1) or off (0) of a bit, and represents a set of partial structures Represents the characteristics of the molecule. There are two types of fingerprints, fixed-length FP and variable-length FP. Formerly, MACSKey fixed-length FP (FP whose partial structure and index have been determined in advance) was used, but now ECFP 4 (It is common to use a variable-length FP called Morgan2).

As for the RDKit fingerprint, please read link:https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf[Developper of RDKit, Greg's Slide] for details.

Let's do similarity evaluation using this ECFP 4 (Morgan 2) this time.

.Difference between SMILES and fingerprint
****
SMILES is an ASCII string representation of the structure, and a fingerprint is a binary representation of the presence or absence of a substructure. The difference is that the former is one of the ** structural expressions **, while the latter is one of the ** feature expressions **.
Since only the presence or absence of partial structures is expressed, information such as the relationship between partial structures (how connected by positional relationship) is lost, and the original structure is not restored.

Some people call it Bag-of-Fragments because it corresponds to Bag-of-Words often used in text mining.

=== Let's calculate similarity

Let's evaluate the similarity of toluene and chlorobenzene as simple molecules.

[source, python]
----
from rdkit import Chem, DataStructs
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem, Draw
from rdkit.Chem.Draw import IPythonConsole
----

Read molecule from SMILES.

[source, python]
----
mol1 = Chem.MolFromSmiles("Cc1ccccc1")
mol2 = Chem.MolFromSmiles("Clc1ccccc1")
----

Confirmed it by visual observation.

[source, python]
----
Draw.MolsToGridImage([mol1, mol2])
----

[source, python]
----
fp1 = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(mol1, 2)
fp2 = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(mol2, 2)
----

Tanimoto coefficient is used for similarity evaluation.

[source, python]
----
DataStructs.TanimotoSimilarity(fp1, fp2)
# 0.5384615384615384
----

=== Virtual screening 

So far we have described how to evaluate the similarity of compounds. Using this index of similarity to select a specific group of compounds from a large number of compounds is called virtual screening.

For example, if a compound that is likely to be a drug is published in a patent or a paper, or a compound that is likely to be promising is found in our assay system, similar compounds in the compound library database of our company or the database of commercially available compounds are more promising I want to find out if there is something like that. Here, it is possible to purchase an analog of influenza drug which is known as a neuraminidase inhibitor link:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/beta/compound_report_card/CHEMBL466246/[Inavir] link:Find out using http://zinc15.docking.org/[ZINC].

The molecular weight of Inavir was about 350, and LogP was about -3. So we selected the fraction of the molecular weight 350-375 and LogP -1 from ZINC. This section is divided into 16 files, but download and use only the first set.

NOTE: We described how to download the data in chapter 4.

We can perform shell command on jupyter notebool by starting from !. The following is an example of downloading ZINC data set with wget command on jupyter notebook

[source, python]
----
!wget http://files.docking.org/2D/EA/EAED.smi
----

Read SMILES from file and make it a mol object, but skip the first line because it is a header. Also, the last character of each line is a newline character, so it is excluded as l [:-1]. Finally, find out how many compounds there are.

[source, python]
----
mols = []
with open("EAED.smi") as f:
    f.readline()
    for l in f:
        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(l[:-1])
        mols.append(mol)
print(len(mols))
# 195493
----

Next, prepare a function to check the degree of similarity with Inavir (LANIMAMIBIR).

[source, python]
----
laninamivir = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CO[C@H]([C@H](O)CO)[C@@H]1OC(=C[C@H](NC(=N)N)[C@H]1NC(=O)C)C(=O)O")
laninamivir_fp = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(laninamivir, 2)

def calc_laninamivir_similarity(mol):
    fp = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(mol, 2)
    sim = DataStructs.TanimotoSimilarity(laninamivir_fp, fp)
    return sim
----

Check it.

[source, python]
----
similar_mols =[]
for mol in mols:
    sim = calc_laninamivir_similarity(mol)
    if sim > 0.2:
        similar_mols.append((mol, sim))
----

Sort the results in descending order of similarity and retrieve only the first ten.

[source, python]
----
similar_mols.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
mols = [l[0] for l in similar_mols[:10]]
----

Let's draw them.

[source, python]
----
Draw.MolsToGridImage(mols, molsPerRow=5)
----

image::ch06/vs01.png[result]

As you can see if the similarity is confirmed, about 200,000 compounds examined this time can only find a compound with a maximum similarity is 23%. However, ZINC contains 750 million data, so there should be many more similar compounds in it.

=== Clustering

For example, when purchasing a commercial compound and creating a library, we want to have as much diversity as possible, so we organize similar compounds and select a representative of them so that only similar compounds are not biased. In this way, if you want to organize compounds by structural similarity, use a method called clustering.

Clustering of 5614 hits from link:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/beta/assay_report_card/CHEMBL1040694/[Novrtis's antimalarial assay]

Import library for clustering and read data.

[source, python]
----
from rdkit.ML.Cluster import Butina
mols = Chem.SDMolSupplier("ch06_nov_hts.sdf")
----

If RDKit can not read the molecule for some reason, it will generate None instead of a mol object. Since passing this None to the GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect method results in an error, so we generate a fingerprint while excluding None.

[source, python]
----
fps = []
valid_mols = []

for mol in mols:
    if mol is not None:
        fp = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect(mol, 2)
        fps.append(fp)
        valid_mols.append(mol)
----

フィンガープリントから距離行列（下三角の距離行列）を生成します。

[source, python]
----
distance_matrix = []
for i, fp in enumerate(fps):
    similarities = DataStructs.BulkTanimotoSimilarity(fps[i], fps[:i+1])
    distance_matrix.extend([1-sim for sim in similarities])
----

Cluster compounds using a distance matrix. The third argument is the distance threshold. In this example, clustering is performed on compounds with a distance of 0.2 or 80% or more.

[source, python]
----
clusters = Butina.ClusterData(distance_matrix, len(fps), 0.2, isDistData=True)
----

Check number of cluster.

[source, python]
----
len(clusters)
#2492
----

Visualize structures of first cluster.

[source, python]
----
mols_ =[valid_mols[i] for i in clusters[0]]
Draw.MolsToGridImage(mols_, molsPerRow=5)
----

In this case, clustering was performed using the library provided in RDKit, but some methods can be used with link:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html[Scikit-learn].  And in practice this method is often used.

=== Structure Based Drug Design(SBDD)

Here we evaluate the similarity of link:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/beta/compound_report_card/CHEMBL231779/[apixaban] and link:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/beta/compound_report_card/CHEMBL198362/[rivaroxaban], which are marketed as anticoagulants.

[source, python]
----
apx = Chem.MolFromSmiles("COc1ccc(cc1)n2nc(C(=O)N)c3CCN(C(=O)c23)c4ccc(cc4)N5CCCCC5=O")
rvx = Chem.MolFromSmiles("Clc1ccc(s1)C(=O)NC[C@H]2CN(C(=O)O2)c3ccc(cc3)N4CCOCC4=O")
----

[source, python]
----
Draw.MolsToGridImage([apx, rvx], legends=["apixaban", "rivaroxaban"])
----

image::ch06/apx_rvx.png[APX+RVX, width=600, pdfwidth=60%]

The structures are quite similar as you can see, but both of these two compounds are known to bind similarly to the same pocket of the serine protease FXa and to inhibit the function of the protein.

[source, python]
----
apx_fp = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(apx, 2)
rvx_fp = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(rvx, 2)

DataStructs.TanimotoSimilarity(apx_fp, rvx_fp)
# 0.40625
----

It's about 40% similarity.  In fact, both link:https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2P16[apixaban] and link:https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2W26[rivaroxaban] both have their complex crystal structures solved and were drawn usinglink:https://pymol.org/2/[PyMOL].

 NOTE:: It does not explain how to use PyMOL because it exceeds the contents of this document, but if you are interested, Please refer to link:http://www.protein.osaka-u.ac.jp/rcsfp/supracryst/suzuki/jpxtal/Katsutani/index.php[here].

As you can see from the figure, apixaban and rivaroxaban are beautifully overlapping in three dimensions. In particular, methoxyphenyl and chlorothiol are located in a site called S1 pocket and are said to have some kind of strong interaction. As the ligand binding sites (pockets) of proteins become clearer, it becomes easier for the medicinal chemist to develop a strategy for the next modification, and the success rate and progress rate of the project will increase.

An approach that optimizes the structure based on the shape of the protein determined by X-ray or cryoelectric testing is called Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD). Also, if you know the pocket, you can screen for compounds that physically bind to the pocket, which is called structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), and ligand-based virtual screening as you did in the previous chapter. It may be distinguished from (LBVS).

.History of Xa inhibitors and the importance of quantum chemistry calculation
****
Although the contents of the chemoinformatics in this book are far apart, it is very useful in molecular design to trace the history of FXa inhibitors and to understand what improvements have been made through generations . In addition, since the interpretation of the S1 pocket interaction is very difficult visually and in classical mechanics, it can be interpreted only by quantum chemical calculation such as Fragment Molecular Orbital Method(FMO), so it is a mistake that quantum chemical calculation becomes essential in future molecular design I think.
